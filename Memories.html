            <p>It's been a whole year since we all took that big step of joining this college! <br>
                A year ago, we all started this new journey as individuals, stepping into <br> 
                a new world full of opportunities, challenges, and experiences.😇<br>
                From the  Classmates to  Best friends🤗<br>
                And if you Remember our conversation too was started with Thank You.😅 <br>
                I know ,you don't like when I say thank you to you. But today it's your day and I have the whole right to appreciate you.. <br> Thank You so much for coming in my life and always supporting , motivating me in every situation.😊

            <p>Remember the Day of Spectrum 2024.... ✨<br>
                We had taken part in the Eparadox but due to some reason , You were not willing to come on that day.. 😢<br>
                But you messaged and wished All the best to me 😃<br>
                From that Moment You became my Best friend 🥰<br>
                I still remember How I wished you All the best in every round 😄<br>
                On that day, I was feeling really very Proud for your Victory ✌😌<br>

        <p>This day was the most Memorable day of my Life..☺<br>
            After so many years I played Holi with Friends.. <br>
            The whole day we spent in Canteen , roaming in college campus with playing games and lot of fun 🤩<br>
            On that day , you told me "We experience this College Life only once , Enjoy it.. <br>
            Go outside and spend time with friends"✨<br>
            From that day , I really started enjoying every day with my Friends 🎉<br>

        <p>After the completion of FY, even during vacation, you were always there for me. ✨<br>
         When I was going home, I thought I wouldn’t be able to talk to you or share my stories with you.<br>
        But thank goodness for the Gmail app! 😅 See my gmail completely filled with you ..😄<br>It was such a great and memorable experience. 😌 <br>However, I was really very tensed when you said that you are in depression 🥺<br>
        Promise me , you will never think too much and feel depressed ..

            <p>This was the day when our bond of friendship became more strong due to this thread of care and protection.😇<br>
                We shared so many things that day and on that day I came to
                know that my friend is very responsible son.<br>
               I also know that how much you love and care for your mother. 🥰<br>
